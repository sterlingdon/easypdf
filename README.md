# Easy PDF

> **Don't worry about PDF anymore.**

[中文 README](./README.zh-CN.md)

Easy PDF is a powerful, comprehensive, and exquisitely designed web application dedicated to modifying, converting, and managing PDF files. Our mission is simple: to provide a robust set of PDF tools with a user interface that is cleaner, faster, and more intuitive than anything else on the market.

We believe that robust functionality shouldn't come at the cost of usability. Easy PDF brings you professional-grade PDF manipulation tools wrapped in a minimalist, accessible design.

## Motivation

The domain of PDF editing and manipulation is fiercely competitive, yet most solutions are paid and offer poor user experiences. **"The world has suffered under Adobe for too long."**

With the power of modern AI, the cost of software production has significantly decreased. We believe it is time for the PDF industry to undergo a transformation.

## Mission

We hope that everyone in the world can use free, high-quality PDF handling software. To support this goal, Easy PDF will not only be available as a web application but will also be bundled as standalone client software for both **macOS** and **Windows**.
